# About me

My name is Lawrence Pan and I am a Software Engineering student at the
University of Waterloo.

I am currently interested in learning and building large-scale data-intensive
applications.

TL;DR? [Download my résumé]({{ site.resume_url }}).

## Projects

### [lpan/viw](https://github.com/lpan/viw)

VI Worsened (viw) is my coolest project so far. It is a VI-like, terminal-based
text editor with undo & redo written in C. I drew inspirations from `log-based
replication`, `data-driven programming` and the `flux architecture`. Make sure
to read my blog [What I learnt from coding a text editor in
C](/what-i-learnt-from-viw)

### [lpan/rebash](https://github.com/lpan/rebash)

Rebash is definitely one of my most underrated projects. Most people I talked to
showed 0 interest in it. However, this project is what got me into functional
programming. It is a `configurable` terminal emulator React component. I was too
lazy to style it but trust me, it is really cool.

## Work experience

### [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com)
I am currently working at Datadog as a back-end engineering intern.

### [Universe](https://www.universe.com)
I worked at Universe (a division of Ticketmaster) as a full-stack engineering
intern from `May 2017` to `August 2017`.

I first worked on the embedded widgets code base. I upgraded react-router from
v2 to v4, set up code splitting and completely redesigned the third-party script
that deploys Universe's embedded widgets. This allows multiple embeddable
widgets to exist in the same repository and to be deployed in a uniform way. It
also unlocks many previously impossible features such as widget customization.

Toward the end of my internship, I worked with the platform team to release
Universe's public GraphQL API. I was involved with reimagining Universe's domain
models. I also shipped Universe's first single page application that consumes
the new GraphQL endpoint to production.

### [Plotly](https://plot.ly)
I worked at Plotly as a front-end engineering intern from `May 2016` to `August
2016`.

At Plotly, my job was maintaining a large-scale React & Redux SaaS application
that interacts with [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js).

I was involved with Flux to Redux migration. I also helped introducing different
user tiers (pro user vs free user). I came up with an abstraction that
simplifies front-end feature access control.
