Hi there, my name is Lawrence Pan and I am a Software Engineering student at the
University of Waterloo, Class of 2021.

I love coding from the very bottom of my heart and always look forward to
learning new technologies. I like to write simple, clean, and maintainable, code.

I am also a [Free Software](http://www.fsf.org/) activist. I donate annually to
the Free Software Foundation as a student associative member and run GNU/Linux
exclusively on my laptop. I am currently on {{ site.operation_system }} with
the {{ site.desktop_environment }} desktop environment.

For development, I use Neovim and Tmux. You can check out my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/lpan/dotfiles) for more details.

In my spare time, I read, write blog articles, lift weights or play sports. I
rowed competitively and played intercity soccer when I was in high school.
