Hi there, my name is Lawrence Pan and I am a Software Engineering student at the
University of Waterloo, class of 2021.

I love coding from the very bottom of my heart and always look forward to
learning new technologies. I like to write simple, clean and maintainable code.

I have a special affection for functional programming. Here is my favourite
quote from Alan Perlis: 

> It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10
> functions on 10 data structures

I always prefer functional programming over imperative programming when I am
developing in a multi-paradigm language, especially JavaScript.

I am also a [Free Software](http://www.fsf.org/) activist. I donate annually to
the Free Software Foundation as a student associative member and run GNU/Linux
exclusively on my laptop. I am currently on [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) with
Gnome 3.

For development, I use Neovim and Tmux. You can check out my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/lpan/dotfiles) for more details.

In my spare time, I read, write blog articles, lift weights or play sports. I
rowed competitively and played intercity soccer when I was in high school.
