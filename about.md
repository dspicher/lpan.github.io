# About me

My name is Lawrence Pan and I am a Software Engineering student at the
University of Waterloo.

applications.

## Projects

### [lpan/viw](https://github.com/lpan/viw)

VI Worsened (viw) is my coolest project so far. It is a VI-like, terminal-based
text editor with undo & redo written in C. I drew inspirations from `log-based
replication`, `data-driven programming` and the `flux architecture`. Make sure
to read my blog [What I learnt from coding a text editor in
C](/what-i-learnt-from-viw)

### [lpan/rebash](https://github.com/lpan/rebash)

Rebash is definitely one of my most underrated projects. Most people I talked to
showed 0 interest in it. However, this project is what got me into functional
programming. It is a `configurable` terminal emulator React component. I was too
lazy to style it but trust me, it is really cool.
