# About me

My name is Lawrence and I am a Software Engineering student at the University of
Waterloo.

I believe in `the right tool for the right job`, and thus I am constantly
learning and experimenting new technologies to expand my toolbox.

I pride myself in being a well-rounded full-stack developer. I have a strong
background in modern web UI development and I have professional experience doing
back-end work with Rails, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

I am currently learning Clojure and distributed systems.

**TL;DR?** [Download my résumé]({{ site.resume_url }}).

# Projects

## VI Worsened
*[github.com/lpan/viw](https://github.com/lpan/viw)*

Viw is my coolest project so far. It is a VI-like, terminal-based text editor
with undo & redo written in C. I drew inspirations from `event sourcing`,
`data-driven programming` and the `flux architecture`. Make sure to read my blog
[What I learnt from coding a text editor in C](/what-i-learnt-from-viw)

## Rebash
*[github.com/lpan/rebash](https://github.com/lpan/rebash)*

Rebash is definitely one of my most underrated projects. Most people I talked to
showed 0 interest in it. However, this project is what got me into functional
programming. It is a `configurable` terminal emulator React component. I was too
lazy to style it but trust me, it is really cool.

# Work experience

## [Universe](https://www.universe.com)
I worked at Universe as a full-stack engineer co-op from `May 2017` to `August
2017`.

I first worked on the embedded widgets code base. I upgraded react-router from
v2 to v4, set up code splitting and completely redesigned the third-party script
that deploys Universe's embedded widgets. This allows multiple embeddable
widgets to exist in the same repository and to be deployed in a uniform way. It
also unlocks many previously impossible features such as widget customization,
etc.

Toward the end of my co-op term, I worked with the platform team to release
Universe's public GraphQL API. I was involved with reimagining Universe's domain
models. I also shipped Universe's first single page application that consumes
the new GraphQL endpoint to production.

## [Plotly](https://plot.ly)
I worked at Plotly as a front-end engineer co-op from `May 2016` to `August
2016`.

At Plotly, my job was maintaining a large-scale React & Redux SaaS application
that interacts with [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js).

I was involved with Flux to Redux migration. I also helped introducing different
user tiers (pro user vs free user). I came up with an abstraction that
simplifies front-end feature access control.
