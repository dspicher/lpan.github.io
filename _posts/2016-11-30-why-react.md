## Intro
Many people jumped on the React bandwagon without knowing why do they need this
particular library. A good number of them do not even have any prior web
development experience. They decided to learn React just because they skimmed
through a `What Front-End framework should I learn in 2016` article or found out
that **[Insert Company Name Here]** adapts React to its Front-End stack. In
truth, React is a very powerful and efficient DOM manipulation library that in
my opinion, every web developer should know.

I feel empathy for those people because I too learnt React before knowing its
purposes first. This is not a tutorial. This article is written to help you
understand why do you want to build your next application with React in lieu of
JQuery or just Vanilla JS.

In short, React is just a DOM manipulation library. It makes binding data to the
DOM easier. If you are familiar with JQuery, you can view React as the
*declarative and functional JQuery*.

So why do you want React?

1. **Faster and simpler Data -> DOM**
2. **Functional react programming** (More predictable)

<br>

### 1. Data -> DOM
I like Malcolm Gladwell, so I have a list of some of his books.
{% highlight javascript %}
const books = ['Outliers', 'David and Goliath', 'Blink'];
{% endhighlight %}

Now, I want to display these books on my personal website because I want to show
my support.

**Vanilla JS ↴**

{% highlight html %}
<ul id="books">
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
const books = ['Outliers', 'David and Goliath', 'Blink'];
const booksContainer = document.getElementById('books');

books.forEach(book => {
  const bookNode = document.createElement('li');
  bookNode.appendChild(document.createTextNode(book));
  booksContainer.appendChild(bookNode)
});

renderBooks(books);
{% endhighlight %}

Super tedious isn't it? You not only have to use a nasty for loop but also have
to deal with these disgusting low-level APIs. `document.createTextNode`? Yuck!

**JQuery**

{% highlight html %}
<ul id="books">
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
const books = ['Outliers', 'David and Goliath', 'Blink'];

books.forEach(book => {
  $('#books').append(`<li>${book}</li>`);
});
{% endhighlight %}

You are smart. You want your code to be nice and clean. So you decided to use a
DOM manipulation library. Here comes JQuery. Now your code is free of low-level
APIs. You can easily render the list with a for loop and some mutations.

**React! ↴**

{% highlight html %}
<div id="app">
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
const books = ['Outliers', 'David and Goliath', 'Blink'];
const Books = ({books}) => (
  <ul>
    {books.map((book, i) => <li key={i}>{book}</li>}
  </ul>
)

ReactDOM.render(<Books books={books} />, document.getElementById('app'));
{% endhighlight %}

Similar to JQuery, with React, you are exempted from working with the raw DOM.
Now, you may wonder, since both libraries abstract DOM manipulation, why do I
want React in lieu of JQuery? The answer is simple,  in contrast to JQuery's
imperative API, the one provided by React is functional which is relatively more
predicable and easier to debug.

<br>

### 2. Functional, Free of Side Effects

Now, what if I want to add more books to the list?

**Vanilla JS ↴**

{% highlight javascript %}
const books = ['Outliers', 'David and Goliath', 'Blink'];
const booksContainer = document.getElementById('books');

function renderBooks(newBooks) {
  while (booksContainer.firstChild) {
    booksContainer.removeChild(booksContainer.firstChild);
  }
  newBooks.forEach(book => {
    const bookNode = document.createElement('li');
    bookNode.appendChild(document.createTextNode(book));
    booksContainer.appendChild(bookNode)
  });
}

renderBooks(books);

const newBooks = books.concat(['What the Dog Saw']);
renderBooks(newBooks);
{% endhighlight %}

We did not only sacrifice the readibility of the code but also performance. To
update the book list, We need to first manually remove the children that are not
in the list anymore.  Then, we append the newly added ones. For simplicity sake,
I just remove all of the children regardless and append the new list back to the
`bookContainer`. As you can see, if you want to minimize DOM manipulation to
maximize performance, it can get pretty ugly.

The JQuery implementation will be a bit cleaner but similar in terms of logic.

**React! ↴**

{% highlight javascript %}
const books = ['Outliers', 'David and Goliath', 'Blink'];

const Books = ({books}) => (
  <ul>
    {books.map((book, i) => <li key={i}>{book}</li>)}
  </ul>
)

const root = document.getElementById('app');

ReactDOM.render(<Books books={books} />, root);

const newBooks = books.concat(['What the Dog Saw']);
ReactDOM.render(<Books books={newBooks} />, root);
{% endhighlight %}

React provides an efficient diff algorithm that will update the DOM with
minimized DOM manipulation. We call `render` again and the list displayed on the
DOM gets updated.
