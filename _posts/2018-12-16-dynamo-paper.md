# Background

So I finally finished reading Martin Kleppmann's [Designing Data-Intensive
Applications](http://dataintensive.net/), the bible for implementing distributed
data infrastructure and systems. To celebrate, I decided to read the legendary
[Dynamo
Paper](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf).

Academic papers are intimidating though. This is why, before I started reading
the Dynamo paper, I decided to read this other paper, ["How to read a
paper"](https://www.albany.edu/spatial/WebsiteFiles/ResearchAdvices/how-to-read-a-paper.pdf).

If you don't know how to read papers, how do you read this paper to learn how to
read papers? Just kidding.

Anyway, this paper was a short and fun read, even though it is not 100% relevant
to my expectation of paper reading. For example, the paper suggested techniques
to determine whether a paper is worth reading, as well as ways to critique a
paper. But at least for now, I am only planning to read already peer-reviewed
papers. But this paper definitely brought up many very interesting and useful
concepts, such as the "three-pass approach". If you are also new to papers
reading like I am, I would definitely recommend you to give it a read.

opinion, each paper is
